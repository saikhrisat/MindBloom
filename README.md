MindBloom is a modern, web-based mind mapping application designed to help you visually organize thoughts, brainstorm ideas, and structure information in an intuitive and fluid way. It solves the limitations of linear note-taking by providing a dynamic, expandable canvas where ideas can grow and connect organically.

The application is enhanced with AI-powered features to help users overcome creative blocks and explore new avenues of thought, making it a powerful tool for students, writers, developers, and project managers.

## Key Features

-   **Interactive Canvas**: A smooth, pannable, and zoomable canvas to build and navigate your mind maps.
-   **Node Management**:
    -   Easily add child nodes to any idea.
    -   Edit node text with a double-click.
    -   Delete nodes (except the central root node).
    -   Drag and drop nodes to manually organize your map layout. Connection lines automatically follow.
-   **AI-Powered Suggestions**:
    -   Stuck on an idea? Use the "AI Suggest" feature on any node to get a list of relevant child node ideas generated by Google's Gemini model.
-   **Multi-Map Persistence**:
    -   All your mind maps are automatically saved to your browser's local storageâ€”no need to worry about losing work.
    -   Create and manage multiple mind maps.
    -   A "Load Saved Mind Maps" dialog lets you view, load, or delete any of your saved maps.
-   **Responsive Design & Theming**:
    -   The application is fully responsive and works on various screen sizes.
    -   Switch between light and dark modes to suit your preference.

## Technology Stack

MindBloom is built with a modern, type-safe, and performant tech stack:

-   **Framework**: [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) ( leveraging the App Router, Server Components, and Server Actions)
-   **Language**: [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
-   **UI Library**: [React](https://reactjs.org/)
-   **Component Library**: [ShadCN UI](https://ui.shadcn.com/)
-   **Styling**: [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
-   **Icons**: [Lucide React](https://lucide.dev/)
-   **Generative AI**: [Google AI (Gemini)](https://ai.google/) via [Genkit](https://firebase.google.com/docs/genkit), a portable, open-source AI framework.
-   **Deployment**: Ready for deployment on modern Jamstack platforms like [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) or [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).

## How It Works

The project is structured into several key modules that work together to provide a seamless experience:

1.  **State Management (`src/app/page.tsx`)**: The core of the application uses React Hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useCallback`, `useMemo`) to manage the mind map data, layout information, and UI state. All user interactions are handled here and result in state updates.

2.  **Layout Engine (`src/lib/layout.ts`)**: When the mind map's structure changes (e.g., a node is added), a custom layout algorithm calculates the base `x` and `y` positions for all nodes to create a clean, hierarchical tree.

3.  **Rendering (`src/components/mindmap`)**:
    -   The main page calculates `finalLayoutData` by merging the algorithmic layout with any manual drag-and-drop offsets from the state.
    -   This final data is passed to the `Canvas` component.
    -   `NodeRenderer` renders individual nodes, handling editing, selection, and drag initiation.
    -   `ConnectorRenderer` receives the final coordinates for parent-child pairs and draws the SVG lines connecting them.

4.  **AI Logic (`src/ai/flows/suggest-child-nodes.ts`)**:
    -   When a user requests AI suggestions, the client calls a Genkit flow.
    -   This flow, running on the server, takes the context of the parent node and the overall mind map and prompts the Gemini model to generate relevant ideas.
    -   The suggestions are streamed back and displayed in a dialog for the user to select.

5.  **Persistence (`src/lib/localStorage.ts`)**: The entire collection of a user's mind maps is stored as a single entry in the browser's `localStorage`. Functions are provided to load, add, update, and delete maps from this collection, ensuring all work is saved automatically.

## Getting Started

### Running Locally

To run the MindBloom project on your local machine, you'll need Node.js and npm installed.

1.  **Navigate to Project Directory**:
    Open your terminal and navigate to the project's root directory.

2.  **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set Up Environment Variables (for AI Features)**:
    -   Create a file named `.env.local` in the root of your project.
    -   Obtain an API key from [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/).
    -   Add your API key to the `.env.local` file:
        ```
        GOOGLE_API_KEY=YOUR_GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY_HERE
        ```

4.  **Run the Development Servers**:
    This project requires two servers running in parallel for development.

    -   **Terminal 1: Next.js App (UI)**
        ```bash
        npm run dev
        ```
        The application will be available at `http://localhost:9002`.

    -   **Terminal 2: Genkit (AI Backend)**
        ```bash
        npm run genkit:dev
        ```
        This starts the local server that handles the AI flows.


## Future Goals

MindBloom has a solid foundation, but there are many exciting possibilities for the future:

-   **Cloud-Based Sync**: Move beyond `localStorage` to a cloud-based solution (like Firebase Firestore) to allow users to access their mind maps from any device.
-   **Real-Time Collaboration**: Allow multiple users to work on the same mind map simultaneously.
-   **Enhanced AI Features**:
    -   **AI Map Generation**: Generate an entire mind map from a single prompt or topic.
    -   **AI Summarization**: Summarize a branch or the entire mind map.
    -   **AI Theming**: Generate a color palette for the mind map based on its topic.
-   **Advanced Export Options**:
    -   **Multiple Formats**: Add functionality to export mind maps to different formats like PNG, SVG, PDF, and JSON.
    -   **Print-Friendly Layouts**: Provide optimized layouts specifically for printing.
-   **Shareable URLs**: Generate unique, shareable links for mind maps, allowing for read-only viewing or collaboration.
-   **Customizable Nodes**: Allow users to add icons, images, or change colors for individual nodes.
-   **Accessibility Improvements**: Continuously improve keyboard navigation and screen reader support.
